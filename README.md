## Overview
Two course assignments:
- **A1: Implicit Fields.** From point clouds to surfaces using an MLP decoder; losses tailored for occupancy/SDF signals.
- **A2: Diffusion (2D).** Train a noise-prediction network and sample denoised points; visualize trajectories and final distributions.

**Reports:** see `docs/`.
